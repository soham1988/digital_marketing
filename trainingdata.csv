0,"I don't frequently get political on FB anymore  in fact I created a whole separate page for that stuff so as not to annoy my friends here  but I am quite fired up right now so you'll have to indulge me. In fact  some of you out there owe me one.   I was returning home from work today and heard an incredibly obnoxious radio ad. I am not sure if this is a local radio station trying to be cute or an organization of pro-NSA people but it went something to the affect of:  ""Worried the government is spying on you? What are you afraid they are going to find? You're duck-face? Are they going to cross-reference it in a duck-face database? Your inspirational quote? Your Instagram of your food? Your re-post from George Takei? Afraid they are going to find you broke your promise to go to the gym? If the government didn't read your crap than nobody else would. GET OVER YOURSELF!""   (They then said the message was brought to you by 'get over yourself' or something to that affect.)  Wow. Just  'wow.' Have any of you heard this? As amusing as the notion of an NSA Duck-face Database is  this is a total horse-shit ad.  Again  I don't know who made it or what they thought they would accomplish. Maybe its just some professional trolls (local or national) who pawn themselves off as comedians. If they actually looked at my small little page they would probably point out how I'm going off to a handful of followers  and frankly I don't care. A couple of things about whoever made this.  1.) Insult comedy was born from the genius of Don Rickles but it died with Andrew Dice-Clay and had only a brief resurgence when a dog puppet did it  which was due mostly to novelty value. So those hack writers really need to update their style.  2.) Regardless of who did it - be it some hack writers  some old-shool sympathizers of Bush policies  Obama apologists who are feeling defensive right now  big government in general  or hell maybe nutball Alex Jones is right and even the government itself is behind it- this is the third phase of emotional abuse I have observed before in intimate relationships between people and their abusive significant-others  spouses  siblings  parents  etc. Women and young children are the most common victims of this.   First the abusive party dominates and violates the victim physically  emotionally  or in some other way exerts their power over the victim forcefully. In this case our viral privacy was violated with no process of law by a government entity from we cannot escape of opt out.  Next  the violated party is emotionally affected  and articulates their emotional reaction  anger  sadness  etc.  Then  the violator effectively turns it around on the victim and shames them for feeling as they do. The violator further degrades the victim this way and can even make themselves out to be the victim. The expression for this insidious psychological-sleight-of-hand is called ""GASLIGHTING.""  The term comes from a very old film in which a woman is made to think she is going insane by her manipulative husband so he can legally divorce her. Links to be found below.  Folks  who cares if you have nothing to hide  I don't. But I have nothing I particularly feel like sharing either. And I don't have to share it. I put out there on my personal page for friends who can read it or scroll past or filter me altogether. I don't want anyone else seeing my stuff  I don't feel the least bit guilty about it and NEITHER SHOULD YOU. If I found a private abuse of my material or identified a hacker of non-government origin I would feel equally as violated. My boring life is my own to share or not share as I please with whomever I please and they are free to filter me  ignore me  unfriend me etc. AND YOU CAN DO ALL THOSE THINGS RIGHT THE **** now if you so desire. You have every right as a private citizen to take the same stance.  The pro-surveilance crowd (I purposely chose a broad umbrella term to avoid being labeled as a conspiracy nut) has gone from calling it's critics paranoid loonies of questionable sanity and now they are trying to make those of us who were critical and many others who are coming over to that way of thinking to it to feel like we are lesser people for having an emotional reaction to it when it turns out we had the right to criticize all along.  DO NOT LET ANYONE ELSE DEGRADE YOU FOR WHAT YOU FEEL ABOUT SOMETHING.  DO NOT LET ANYONE  (BE IT AN INDIVIDUAL OR A GROUP) GASLIGHT YOU!  DO NOT. TAKE SHIT. FROM ANYBODY! Especially hack-writers and Washington D.C!  This concludes my rant. Showuz over-and-out!

0,"From Shaun King: Action#6 Day#8 of 43 Phase 1 of Injustice Boycott  A core philosophy of the Injustice Boycott is that we have expected and demanded far too little from so called ""progressive"" leaders that we have elected. It's one thing for a conservative who all but promised to be oppressive to actually turn out to be that way and something altogether different for a ""progressive"" leader who campaigned on combatting systemic injustice to then do next to nothing about it.  San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee is such a man. He is the quintessential American progressive who has over-promised and under-delivered on life or death issues of injustice in San Francisco. Under his watch as Mayor  the San Francisco Police Department has not only been gripped with racist scandals  but dozens and dozens of men and women have been killed by police without any measure of prosecution. In fact  that seems to be the San Francisco way. Few officers are ever held accountable for what they do.  That's why the District Attorney of San Francisco formed the Blue Ribbon Panel on Transparency  Accountability  and Fairness in Law Enforcement.  Excuse my language  but that panel  made up of some of the most respected and experienced legal minds in the city  worked their asses off. After months of investigating  the non-partisan panel made 72 findings and 84 recommendations. Their final report was nearly 250 pages long and included thousands of pages of source documents to refer back to.  In essence  they created the blueprint that San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee should be using to transform the San Francisco Police Department from the top down.  It has been clearly spelled out for him. Mayor Lee is an experienced attorney. He understands what the panel presented to him  but he has simply refused to enact any of the reforms. This is not OK.  We must demand that our progressive leaders not only talk the talk  but walk the walk.  TODAY'S ACTIONS  Write the following (or your own modified version) on Twitter. Include @MayorEdLee & #WalkTheWalk & the link to the report::  Dear @MayorEdLee - why have you ignored the 84 recommendations of the Blue Ribbon Panel on Policing. #WalkTheWalk  http://sfblueribbonpanel.com  ---OR  To @MayorEdLee - it's time for you to #WalkTheWalk & actually enact these 84 recommendations for the @SFPD.  http://sfblueribbonpanel.com",vague,progressive

0,"""States could apply for waivers that allow insurance companies in their states to do three things: 1) Charge older people more than five times what they charge young people for the same policy; 2) Eliminate required coverage  called essential health benefits including maternity care  mental health and prescription drugs  required under the Affordable Care Act; and 3) Charge more or deny coverage to people who have pre-existing health conditions  such as cancer  diabetes or arthritis.  The waivers could also impact people with-employer based insurance  because they would allow insurers to offer policies that have annual and lifetime benefit limits  which are banned under the Affordable Care Act  and some companies may choose those policies for their workers to lower their premiums.  States that get waivers would likely see insurance companies offer many more policy options  some with fewer benefits and lower premiums.  Those states would be required under the law to create some other way to ensure that people with expensive illnesses are able to get health care  and the law provides up to $138 billion over 10 years for such programs  typically called high-risk pools.  However  an analysis released Thursday by the consulting form Avalere concludes that that amount would be inadequate to provide full health coverage for the number of people who now buy insurance in the individual market and have medical problems.""",vague,ensure

0,The Supreme Court decision in Obergefell v. Hodges that established homosexual marriage as national policy is unambiguously wrong on at least three crucial levels: Moral  Constitutional  and Structural.  On the Moral Level The CourtÍs decision violates the moral standards specifically enumerated in our founding documents. The Declaration of Independence sets forth the fundamental principles and values of American government  and the Constitution provides the specifics of how government will operate within those principles. As the U. S. Supreme Court has correctly acknowledged: The latter [Constitution] is but the body and the letter of which the former [Declaration of Independence] is the thought and the spirit  and it is always safe to read the letter of the Constitution in the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration first officially acknowledges a Divine Creator and then declares that America will operate under the general values set forth in ñthe laws of nature and of natureÍs God.î The framers of our documents called this the Moral Law  and in the Western World it became known as the Common Law. This was directly incorporated into the American legal system while the colonies were still part of England; following independence  the Common Law was then reincorporated into the legal system of all the new states to ensure its uninterrupted operation; and under the federal Constitution  its continued use was acknowledged by means of the Seventh Amendment in the Bill of Rights. Numerous Founding Fathers and legal authorities  including the U. S. Supreme Court  affirmed that the Constitution is based on the Common Law  which incorporated GodÍs will as expressed through ñthe laws of nature and of natureÍs God.î  Those constitutional moral standards placed the definition of marriage outside the scope of government. As acknowledged in a 1913 case: Marriage was not originated by human law. When God created Eve  she was a wife to Adam; they then and there occupied the status of husband to wife and wife to husband. . . . It would be sacrilegious to apply the designation ña civil contractî to such a marriage. It is that and more _ a status ordained by God. Because marriage ñwas not originated by human law î then civil government had no authority to redefine it. The Supreme CourtÍs decision on marriage repudiates the fixed moral standards established by our founding documents and specifically incorporated into the Constitution. However  our SCOTUS has two lesbians justices and a communist justice none of whom actually believe in a GOD much less a Christian God. Re-electing DEMOCRAT presidents who must be socialists by the very nature of their party ensures we get liberal socialist justices on the court. WHen our constitution was written  socialism did not exist and progressivism (which has since succumbed to socialism) was still relatively moral in its outlook and philosophy  no longer true.   On the Constitutional Level The Constitution establishes both federalism and a limited American government by first enumerating only seventeen areas in which the federal government is authorized to operate  and then by explicitly declaring that everything else is to be determined exclusively by the People and the States (the Ninth and Tenth Amendments).  Thomas Jefferson thus described the overall scope of federal powers by explaining that ñthe States can best govern our home concerns and the general [federal] government our foreign ones.î He warned that ñtaking from the States the moral rule of their citizens and subordinating it to the general authority [federal government] . . . . would . . . break up the foundations of the Union.î The issue of marriage is clearly a ñdomesticî and not a ñforeignî issue  and one that directly pertains to the StateÍs ñmoral rule of their citizens.î But the Supreme Court rejected these limits on its jurisdiction  and America now experiences what Jefferson feared: [W]hen all government  domestic and foreign  in little as in great things  shall be drawn to Washington as the center of all power  it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another. By taking control of issues specifically delegated to the States  the Court has disregarded explicit constitutional limitations and directly attacked constitutional federalism. Since the days of Lincoln  the president and scotus have ignored the actual scope of the constitution and taken every opportunity to consolidate power into the federal government which has NO RELIGIOUS affiliation nor interests. The 1st amendment precludes any federal government interference with speech and religion but since the fifties  our scotus has ignored that fact or used it to decrease any influence that religion (especially Christianity) has upon the nation.   On the Structural Level The Constitution stipulates that ñThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a republican form of governmentî (Article IV  Section 4). A republican form of government is one in which the people elect leaders to make public policy  with those leaders being directly accountable to the people. More than thirty States  by their republican form of government  had established a definition of marriage for their State. The Supreme Court decision directly abridges the constitutional mandate to secure to every state a republican form of government.  To believe that the Judiciary is an independent and neutral arbiter without a political agenda is ludicrous. As Thomas Jefferson long ago observed: Our judges are as honest as other men and not more so. They have  with others  the same passions for party  for power  and the privilege of their corps. Do the readers actually think that even our Chief Justice Roberts has no political ambition or agenda? Consider his opinions on Obamacare and it becomes obvious that political considerations and personal views of federal (partisan) government shaded his opinions. The SCOTUS did not even bother to follow the plain language written into the laws when rendering the decisions concerning Obamacare. Scalia is right to call it SCOTUScare. Judges definitely do have political views and personal agendas; they therefore were given no authority to make public policy. The perils from their doing were too great. As Jefferson affirmed  the judgesÍ ñpower [is] the more dangerous as they are in office for life and not responsible  as the other functionaries are  to the elective control.î He therefore warned: [T]o consider the judges as the ultimate arbiters of all constitutional questions [is] a very dangerous doctrine indeed  and one which would place us under the despotism of an oligarchy. . . . The Constitution has erected no such single tribunal. The Constitution  on this hypothesis  is a mere thing of wax in the hands of the Judiciary which they may twist and shape into any form they please. The Supreme CourtÍs decision is a direct assault on the republican form of government that the Constitution requires be guaranteed to every State. It is still possible to correct the monstrosities of the past year (2015) by Constitutional Amendment or direct Congressional Law but I do not expect either to take place as the nation as a whole has not the courage nor leadership to do so and congress is filled with cowards and way too many democrats.  The Road Ahead The Supreme Courts decree on marriage will become a club to bludgeon the sincerely-held rights of religious conscience  especially of those in the several dozen States who  through their republican form of government  had enacted public policies that conformed to both the Moral Law and the traditional Common Law.  While the Supreme Court decision paid lip service to the rights of religious people to disagree with its marriage decision  history shows that not only does this acknowledgment mean little but also that it will be openly disregarded and ignored  particularly at the local level. After all  there are numerous Supreme Court decisions currently on the books _ including unanimous Court decisions _ protecting the rights of religious expression in public  including for students. Yet such faith expressions continue to be relentlessly attacked by school and city officials at the local and city levels. (See www.religioushostility.org for thousands of such recent examples.)  Even before this decision was handed down  numerous States were already punishing dissenting people of faith  levying heavy fines on them or closing their businesses _ not because those individuals attacked gay marriage but rather because they refused to personally participate in its rites. These governmental actions were initiated by complaints of homosexuals filed with civil rights commissions _ and all of this was already occurring without a Supreme Court decision on which they could rely. Now that such a decision does exist  expect a tsunami of additional complaints to be filed against Christian business owners  and both the frequency and the intensity of the penalties to be increased.  Now is the time to display stand-alone courage on the issue of marriage as well as the judicial activism of the Court _ now is the time to stand up and be counted  regardless of whether anyone else stands with you. Now is the time for individuals to broadly voice support for traditional marriage (which will likely cause you to be verbally berated or attacked by its opponents) as well as for the rights of religious conscience of dissenters (which will cause you to be charged with defending bigots and haters). Good people can no longer be silent and allow themselves to be intimidated by the mean-spirited attacks that occur when you begin to speak out on this issue.  It will soon become obvious that this decision opened a PandoraÍs Box that will initiate a series of policy changes affecting everything from hiring practices to college athletics  from non-profit tax-exempt status to professional licensing standards. So the battle is not over; it is literally just beginning. We have a duty to let our voice be heard. As even Chief Justice Roberts alluded  there is no end to what marriage might be considered  no limitation as to whom one can marry  except as a religious institution. The homosexual lobby has lied for years saying it must have marriage as an equal right so that all deviants may share in the same legal equalities. Pure BS. Nothing was ever required except a simple legal form giving partners equal rights over one another  a form known as a Durable Power of Attorney which is in common use between corporate partners today as it has been for hundreds of years.   Strikingly  duty was the character trait of Jesus. He loved us because it was the right thing to do; He went to the cross because it was the right thing to do; He forgave us because it was the right thing to do. It was His duty. Our Founders repeatedly praised that character trait  and noted the numerous spiritual blessings that came from its performance: The man who is conscientiously doing his duty will ever be protected by that Righteous and All-Powerful Being  and when he has finished his work  he will receive an ample reward. Samuel Adams  SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION  All that the best men can do is to persevere in doing their duty . . . and leave the consequences to Him who made it their duty  being neither elated by success (however great) nor discouraged by disappointment (however frequent and mortifying). John Jay  ORIGINAL CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE U.S. SUPREME COURT  AUTHOR OF THE FEDERALIST PAPERS  The sum of the whole is that the blessing of God is only to be looked for by those who are not wanting in the discharge of their own duty. John Witherspoon  SIGNER OF THE DECLARATION People of faith need to regain the concept of duty  and we would do well to adopt the motto that characterized the efforts of Founding Father John Quincy Adams: ñDuty is ours  results are GodÍs.î Now is the time for people of faith to be silent no more. This blogger blames the churches and weak people of faith who've refused for years to speak out against sin however obvious and who've accepted socialism  communism  progressivism  and the deterioration of the democrat party and nation because of fear of condemnation or simple minded politically correct thinking. I have watched and listened to many young people too naive to recognize how their acceptance of the sins of friends and relatives has hurt the church and nation and believe the sins accepted were because the parents  elders  teachers  and church pulpits never taught them how sins can accelerate and acceptance cause harm to more than merely the sinners themselves.

Best buy? Not so much. Consumption is a big evil in the world and this time of the year doesn't make it any better.

1,This is what happens when you have a $5 Amazon Prime Pantry credit because you took advantage of No-Rush shipping and you decide to use that credit on a snack run.  Therein are a few bags of chips and popcorn  a 12-pack of La Croix lime-flavored water  a pack of Lemon Creme Oreos  a box of Kashi Sweet Potato cereal  a 12-pack of green V-8  and a six-roll pack of Seventh Generation unbleached paper towels.  I had not bought Oreos in years  so I had no idea that they now open from the front (which they call the top) instead of the sides - I started to open this pack from one of the sides when I noticed the pull tab on the front of the pack (because the front is the new top  right?). Oh  the Lemon Creme Oreos should be a permanent flavor.  The Food Should Taste Good Kimchi flavored tortilla chips didn't really taste much like kimchi (perhaps I should pick up some kimchi in the international food aisle of my local grocery store and dip these chips in it).  The Lay's Greektown Gyro flavored potato chips  on the other hand  were even better than a real gyro - and that scares the hell out of me. It's going to take me a while to get to the other goodies in this box. If you happen to be a parent  stepparent  or grandparent of a college-age child  stepchild  or grandchild  send him/her a Pantry box full of goodies for those late-night study sessions.,vague,kashi

1,"1997 Ford F250 H.D. Extended Cab  For Sale  $4900 or best offer.  (Cash always talks) REDUCED TO $3900 FIRM   I hate to part with him  as I am feeling like I am parting with a family member  but times dictate the sale.  It's an all-around great truck if you are into mudding or trail riding  pulling stuff or even if you go to the Silver Lake Sand Dunes where this truck was there about 30 times last year  and like most trips with this truck there  it spent more time rescuing others than just having fun with him.  Would even make a good farm truck too.  It is a 15 year old truck and definitely not brand new  as there is some rust here and there  but with a little bit of work it would not only be a great ""go"" truck as it already is  but a great ""show"" truck too.  Here's the details from either what I know for sure or the prior owner told me:  *460 cubic inch engine  fuel injected  with a K & N cold air intake style system.  *Custom dual exhaust  headers going into Flowmaster mufflers  *Custom front bumper  strong enough to pull trucks out with.  *Pioneer AM/FM/CD/MP3 Stereo  *Bucket seats  *Power Windows/Locks  *AC and cruise control still work after all these years  *1 ton axels with 4.88 gears and locked differentials.  (All four tires spin/dig when in 4wd)  *Approximately 8 inch suspension lift  *Almost new (about 2000 miles on them) Cooper Discoverer STT 37 inch offroad tires  *Aluminum 17inch rims  *Replaced Shocks  front calipers  rear most spring shackels  battery  and a few other smaller items in 2012.  *Includes pictured toolbox in bed and a full sized spare on a steel rim and another spare without rim.  (took the best two when replacing all four tires and got rid of the other two)  There is a few small minor repairs that might be needed to be done  but doesn't affect daily driving  such as there's a small exhaust leak (where exit from header meets the first pipe going out  just needs new bolts)  windshield squirter motor needs replaced and the 4-way hazard switch/button is intermittent.    Will deliver just about anywhere if you kick in for the fuel  or pick up near Midland/Sanford  Michigan.  Clean title and bill of sale included at time of purchase.",unique,ford

My first taste was with the hazelnut  because that is my favorite. The second I decided to make a moca - carmel concoction and it was very tasty.

0,The Supreme Court on Friday refused to delay implementation of a federal judge's ruling striking down Florida's ban on gay marriage. But the state continues to argue that gay couples will only be allowed to marry in the one county named in the lawsuit.  ñThe advice provided by Greenberg Traurig to our client  the Florida Association of Clerks and Comptrollers  addresses a Florida clerk's duties under existing Florida law  which prohibits the issuance of same-sex marriage licenses î Hilarie Bass  the firm's Miami-based co-president  told the Miami Herald. ñCurrent Florida law makes it a crime _ punishable by imprisonment or a fine _ to issue a marriage license to a same-sex couple. Greenberg Traurig is not advising the clerks as to the constitutionality of the Florida ban on same-sex marriage.î  Equality Florida criticized the memo  saying it had generated confusion and described it as an ñexaggerated warningî in a statement. ñClerks can stand in the doorway and try to block equality or they can welcome gay couples who have waited for decades for this moment î said Equality Florida CEO Nadine Smith. ñWe expect every clerk to uphold their oath and protect the constitutional rights of gay couples seeking marriage licenses. No legal firm's memo overrides their clear legal obligation.î,unique,florida

0,"http://patriotpost.us/alexander/33801  Alexander's Column   The Left's Latest 2A Assault: Ban Ammo  Incremental Infringement of the Second Amendment  By Mark Alexander ‡ March 11  2015   Print   ""The ultimate authority ... resides in the people alone. ... The advantage of being armed  which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition."" --James Madison (1788)  2015-03-11-5d975397_large.jpg    I know you're shocked -- SHOCKED -- to learn that Democrats have been caught chipping away at the Second Amendment again  now one round at a time. If nothing else  they are persistent.  In 2008  a ""nobody from nowhere"" presidential candidate who had mastered the art of the ""BIG Lie"" mesmerized an audience with his faux provincial twang  insisting  ""I believe in the Second Amendment. I believe in people's lawful right to bear arms. I will not take your shotgun away. I will not take your rifle away. I won't take your handgun away.""  Again  in 2011  attempting to defend his lawless Fast and Furious gun control charade  Barack Obama asserted correctly  ""The president of the United States is bound by our Constitution "" a constraint he completely disregards. He then repeated his ""I believe"" declaration: ""I believe in the Second Amendment. It does provide for Americans the right to bear arms for protection  for their safety  for hunting  for a wide range of uses.""  ""A wide range of uses"" indeed. First and foremost among them is to defend the endowment of Liberty  or  as the Founders put it  ""the security of a free state.""  For the record  it is irrelevant whether Obama ""believes in the Second Amendment"" or not. What is relevant is that constitutional Rule of Law supersedes the lawless rule of men advocated by this president and his Leftist cadres.  James Madison aptly summed up the real reason Americans  and all people  should be armed: ""The advantage of being armed ... forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition."" Thus  disarming Americans and removing that barrier has been the highest ambition of the statist leaders of the Democratic Party for the last three decades.  2015-03-11-876a4b0e.jpg    Disarmament by incremental encroachment is the modus operandi of Obama and his criminal co-conspirator  Eric Holder  who recently lamented  ""[T]he single failure that I point to in my time as attorney general is that I was not able to ... convince Congress to really follow the will of the American people -- which was to enact meaningful  reasonable gun-safety measures."" In other words  Liberty was preserved  despite Holder's best efforts.  In fact  Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) unwittingly affirmed the motive for the Left's assault on weapons. Laughably implying that the Second Amendment is about protecting the right to hunt  Murphy said he hasnÍt met ""a single hunter or a single person who hunts for sport"" who needs more than 10 rounds in a weapon. Instead  he believes those who want more than 10 rounds are ""arming against the government.""  As discomforting as this thought might be for many Americans  they all owe a debt of gratitude to gun owners  who understand that it is not only our constitutional right but our duty to stand prepared to defend Liberty over tyranny.  As James MadisonÍs appointee  Justice Joseph Story  wrote  ""The right of the citizens to keep and bear arms has justly been considered  as the palladium of the liberties of a republic; since it offers a strong moral check against the usurpation and arbitrary power of rulers."" Leftists would rather you not have that ""strong moral check"" against their relentless assault on the Liberties enshrined in our Constitution.  While Obama and his fellow Democrats controlled both the House and Senate until the House-cleaning of 2010  they didn't manage to pass any substantive legislation that infringed upon the 2A ""right to keep and bear arms.""  But that midterm ""shellacking"" was a mere bump in the road for Obama.  2015-03-11-d0fc9ccb_medium.jpg    Frustrated by their inability to override the Second Amendment legislatively  in September of 2013 Obama and his left-hand man  John Kerry  decided to turn to ""super-authorities"" who they believe have superior authority to our Constitution. They signed the United Nations' Arms Trade Treaty  ostensibly regulating small arms trade between nations  but which could be clearly construed to infringe upon rights within a nation's borders. At the signing ceremony  Kerry claimed  ""Make no mistake  we would never think about supporting a treaty that is inconsistent with the rights of Americans  the rights of American citizens to be able to exercise their guaranteed rights under our Constitution. This is about keeping Americans safe and keeping America strong. This treaty will not diminish anyoneÍs freedom.""  Note that Kerry did not specify what rights. Make no mistake  fellow Patriots: The UN's Arms Trade Treaty is a Trojan Horse.  Obama's last legislative shot at constricting 2A rig hts ended with another shellacking in the 2014 midterm Republican Wave that washed away his Senate majority.  Still  Obama has 700 days to use his phone and his pen  and hordes of Leftist administrators at the helm of federal bureaucracies stand ready to do his bidding.  Obama's latest subterfuge in the name of ""sensible gun control policy"" is to control ""gun violence."" Thus  he has ordered his administrators at the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms and Explosives to ban a common cartridge type popular with shooters of AR-15s  the firearm Obama and Holder would most like to ban.  Share   Since they can't ban the rifle itself  they're attempting to ban the ammunition by outlawing its 5.56mm M855 ""green tip"" cartridge.  Ostensibly  the administration argues  the ban is intended ""to protect the lives and safety of law enforcement officers from the threat posed by ammunition capable of penetrating a protective vest when fired from a handgun."" However  according to FBI and ATF records  fortunately there is no record of a police officer ever having been murdered with an M855 round. Ever. In fact  James Pasco  executive director of the nation's largest police association  the Fraternal Order of Police  debunked the ATF's ammo ban  noting  ""Any ammunition is of concern to police in the wrong hands  but this specific round has historically not posed a law enforcement problem.""  2015-03-11-664634dc_medium.png    Having been in law enforcement early in my career  I can tell you that many common knives and other instruments in the wrong hands can penetrate standard soft body armor.  So supremely confident was Obama that he could ram through his ammo ban and conduct an end-run around objections  the news was published in the ATF's latest annual Firearms Regulation Reference Guide before it was even enacted.  Fortunately  this back-door ban received the immediate attention of 238 House members  who signed a strong letter of protest initiated by H ouse Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-VA). The letter  addressed to the ATF's director  notes that the agency ""establishes an unduly restrictive standard  does not comport with the letter or spirit of the law  and will interfere with Second Amendment rights by disrupting the market for ammunition that law abiding Americans use for sporting and other legitimate purposes.""  Of course  the Second Amendment has nothing to do with ""sporting purposes"" and everything to do with prohibiting the government from infringing on ""the right of the people to keep and bear Arms "" in support and defense of Liberty.  But the plain language of our Constitution has never been a barrier to Barack Obama's lawless administration. As mouthpiece Josh Earnest explained  ""I'd put this in the category of common-sense steps our government can take.""  Gosh  who could oppose ""common sense""?  The ATF backtracked  claiming the regulation as printed ""was an error which has no legal impact on the validity of the exemptions."" Unfortunately  that doesn't mean the ban won't take effect at some later date  and if Obama succeeds he will then target other ammo.  It is ironic that Obama packaged the ammo ban ruse as a ""police protection"" measure after he spent most of last year spewing race-bait rhetoric against those same police  giving credence to the Left's slanderous claim that the reason blacks are arrested more often than those of other races is because cops are racist. However  Obama couldn't resort to the Left's old claim that ""more guns equal more crime "" given that the FBIÍs Uniform Crime Reports indicate violent crime has dropped almost 50% in the last two decades as the number of firearms increased dramatically -- including the sale of more than six million so-called ""assault weapons "" many of which use the M855 cartridge.  For Obama and his Leftists  the ""inconvenient truth"" is that  by every objective measure  more guns equal less crime. By extension  the same is true of ammunition. The real motive behind the Left's ""guns and ammo"" ban is to undermine the ability of today's American Patriots to defend Liberty and Rule of Law.

0,23. Before Sunrise (1995)  One of my favorite romantic films from the 90s is Richard LinklaterÍs Before Sunrise. The plot is simple  a young man meets a young woman on a train in Europe and asks her to spend the day with him in Vienna before he has to catch his flight the next morning back to the United States  luckily she agrees.  Before Sunrise is a playful representation of young impetuous love. Jesse and Celine  without even learning each others last name grow closer and closer to each other as the night passes. With endless possibilities for the lives ahead of them they continue to question and pry each other on thoughts about love  life  family  religion  and so on. Their night together expresses the hopelessly romantic concept that some couples may just be meant to be.,unique,celine

0,24. Before Sunset (2004)  Almost a decade after the first film Richard Linklater returns to the story of Jesse and Celine (besides their brief appearance in Waking Life). The film takes place nine years after the events in Before Sunrise and luckily the two meet again on the final stop of JesseÍs book tour  pertaining to a novel he wrote based on their original encounter no less  in Paris.  If I had to pick between the two I would go with Before Sunset. The characters have matured and thus so has the expression of their feelings for one another. It's like these characters have become real people  like they have emerged from the fantasy of Sunrise and into the real world. This makes me feel more invested in the future of their relationship and the urgency of their affections for each other to be fulfilled.,unique,celine

1,"Rashida Jones thinks celebrities need to keep it in their pants. On Saturday  Oct. 19  the Parks and Recreation actress took to Twitter to voice her displeasure with people -- and  in particular  other famous women -- flashing their private parts (emphasis on private) for all to see.  PHOTOS: Stars' sexy Instagram pictures  ""This week's celeb news takeaway: she who comes closest to showing the actual inside of her vagina is most popular "" the 37-year-old daughter of music producer Quincy Jones and actress Peggy Lipton wrote  along with a hashtag imploring her fellow stars to ""stop acting like whores.""  ""Let me clarify. I don't shame ANYone for anything they choose to do with their lives or bodies...BUT I think we ALL need to take a look at what we are accepting as 'the norm'..."" the Harvard grad explained.  PHOTOS: Nude photos scandals  ""There is a whole generation of young women watching. Sure  be SEXY but leave something to the imagination "" she continued.  Then  in a sarcastic aside  she quipped: ""Also  calling on all men to show me dat ass.""  Jones didn't single out any one female celeb in particular  but plenty of stars have made headlines recently for their barely-there (or not-there-at-all) ensembles.

I prefer to think that Fred Merkle (who later played for the Cubs in the 1918 World Series  one of five he would play in and lose) slapped a curse on the Cubs in retaliation for the destruction of his career and morale.  In any case  the photographs of America in 1908 are great  complete with Davidson of Harley-Davidson and his early motorcycle.,unique,harley-davidson

The gunman was heard shouting anti-gay slurs as he fired.   Deputy Police Chief Brian Foley called the incident a ""potential hate crime "" citing Pastor Sealy's open-door policy of welcoming LGBT Christians to his church: ""Some language used in the incident „ and given where it was  in front of a church known to be accepting of our LGBT community „ it led us to have concern that this is a hate crime "" Deputy Chief Foley told reporters.",unique,hartford

1,"According to my TripAdvisor profile I have either stayed the night eaten a meal or both in 183 cities across 45 states.  That puts me in the ""well-traveled"" category of TripAdvisor users.  What makes me unusual is that none of those cities include Las Vegas or New York City.  So I don't have Las Vegas though I love to place the occasional wager and go to shows.  I haven't been to New York though I love stage plays  good food  and professional sports.  I do  on the other hand  have the diner in Preston  Idaho where Kip Dynamite had a burger with LaFawnda  Linda's Diner in Omaha  Arkansas (since closed) so Deanne Hastings  James Drake and I could count the state  and a gas station ham and cheese sandwich in Fertile  Iowa because out of 250 pastoral candidates I made the Final Three  didn't get the job because someone else was cheaper to move and I wanted to see where I almost lived.",unique,tripadvisor
